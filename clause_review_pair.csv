(a) Financial Closing (as defined in the Implementation Agreement) has occurred in terms of the Implementation Agreement (as may be confirmed by a letter issued by the relevant authority) and as confirmed by the Employer to the Contractor;
(b) the Performance Bond and the Advance Payment Guarantee have been provided by the Contractor in accordance with Clause 4.3(b) and are in full force and effect;
(c) the Advance Payment has been received by the Contractor in accordance with Clause 14.2(b);

Notwithstanding the above, Each party shall use its best efforts to fulfill the above conditions for which it is responsible as soon as practicable. If the conditions detailed in this Sub-Clause are not fulfilled within six (6) months from the date of signing of the Contract, both Parties shall renegotiate and reach a new agreement on the Contract Price and the Time for Completion and/or other relevant conditions. Failure by the Parties to reach an agreement as aforesaid, then either Party may terminate this Contract by giving a fifteen (15) days’ notice to the other Party, in which event, the Employer shall return to the Contractor the securities the latter provided to it (if any), pursuant to which the Parties shall be released from their respective responsibilities and obligations to the other Party under the Contract.

According to 8.1 commencement of works ""in the case of sub-clause (a) below can be waived or deferred (with or without conditions) by the Employer"" , which stipulates Financial Closing shall occur before the Commencement Date. Thus, it can infer that the requirement that Financial Closing shall occur before the Commencement Date could be waived by the Employer. As a result, it can not surely confirm that the Financial Closing Date will be occurred before the Commencement Date."

The terms set out in Clause 7.1 (Limited Notice to Proceed and LNTP Bond) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to any such further Limited Notice to Proceed; provided that the issuance of such further Limited Notice to Proceed shall not entitle the Contractor to an extension of time or to an increase in the Contract Price.
(c) If the Company does not issue the Notice to Proceed within three (3) months of the first Limited Notice to Proceed and all of the conditions precedent set forth in Exhibit A Annex 1 (Conditions Precedent to Full Notice to Proceed) are satisfied except for the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent to initial funding under the Financing Agreements, the Contractor shall be entitled to an adjustment to the Milestone Dates, the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date and/or the Guaranteed Completion Date in accordance with Clause 16.1(d)(iv) (Variations); provided however, that the Contractor shall not be entitled to any additional payment or increase in the Contract Price.

However, 'SCHEDULE 4' states that 'the full amount of the Advance Payment has been paid to the Contractor (or is paid on the Commencement Date).'
